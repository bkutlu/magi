                  b Network.&nbsp;
                | Shows the interactions among genes on the HINT, HPRD, or iRefIndex interaction networks.
                | You can <b>toggle the interaction networks</b> shown by clicking on them in the legend,
                | and you can <b>reposition the nodes </b>in the subnetwork for a better view by <b>dragging/dropping</b> them.

                  b Mutation matrix.&nbsp;
                | Shows the mutations of genes (rows) across samples (columns). Samples are colored by cancer type.
                | Full ticks represent SNVs, downticks represent deletions, upticks represent amplifications,
                | and triangles represent fusions, rearragements or splice variants.
                | Only samples with a mutation in the given subnetwork are shown.
                | You can <b>zoom in on and drag the mutation matrix</b> by scrolling and/or clicking the figure with your mouse.

                i
                  b Transcript annotation.&nbsp;
                | Shows the mutations in each REFSEQ transcript of each gene in the subnetwork.
                | Mutations are colored by cancer type. Each symbol represents a distinct mutation type.
                | Putatively inactivating mutations are shown below the transcript, and the remaining mutations are shown above the transcript.
                | Select one of the three protein domain databases, including Pfam, SMART, and NCBI Conserve Domain, to show annotated protein domains for each transcript -- scroll over a domain to reveal its name.
                | You can <b>zoom in on and drag the transcript annotation</b> by scrolling and/or clicking the figure with your mouse.

                i
                  b Copy number browser.&nbsp;
                | Shows the copy number aberrations surrounding the selected gene (highlighted as red) on the chromosome.
                | The topest panel shows genes (shown as blocks) distributed in the region.
                | You can click and drag a window in this panel to zoom in and see the details in the middle and bottom panels.
                | The middle and bottom panels show genes and copy number aberration inside the zoom in window you just dragged, respectively.
                | Copy number aberrations are colored by cancer type.
                | Each row represents one sample.
                | You can mouseover copy number aberration to get more detail information.
